                <p>Koi is a new ecosystem and economy based on attention. The ecosystem comprises three main parts: 
                    <li>
                        <ul>Creators</ul>
                        <ul>Node Agents</ul>
                        <ul>Developers</ul>
                    </li>
                    To keep the ecosystem thriving, KOI tokens are systematically exchanged between different participants.

                    The future of the internet is quality content freely available to anyone, 
                    not stuck behind paywalls or unskippable ads, 
                    and where already-wealthy companies arenâ€™t profiting from your personal data.
